# University Bus Tracking Application

## 🌍 Overview

The **University Bus Tracking Application** is an end-to-end smart transportation solution designed to resolve long-standing issues in university and school bus systems, including delays, overcrowding, poor communication, and missed schedules. It enables live GPS tracking, dynamic ETA calculations, and direct student-driver communication while offering centralized control to administrators for route and user management.

This system was developed as a semester-long project for BSAD 603 (Project Management) by a team of cybersecurity and software engineering students using Agile methodologies and user-centered design. With a heavy emphasis on real-world feedback and usage metrics, the application not only meets the minimum functional requirements but goes further in ensuring transparency, security, and user satisfaction across all roles.

## 🚀 Project Motivation & Problem Statement

Universities frequently struggle to manage transportation logistics efficiently. Based on collected data:

- 53.1% of students reported frequent delays.
- 53.1% cited overcrowding.
- 12.5% reported missed classes due to poor transit reliability.
- 46.9% requested better communication with drivers.

The current systems lack real-time data, manual coordination is slow, and reporting problems (like reckless driving or overloading) is often ignored. Our application resolves these issues through an intuitive web platform with role-based access and automation.

## 💼 Business Case & Target Audience

### Problem Addressed:

- Frequent Delays: Inability to track live locations.
- Overcrowding & Miscommunication: No transparent data or alerts.
- Missed Classes: No proximity warnings or ETA.

### Value Proposition:

- 75% of surveyed users desired real-time GPS.
- 71.9% requested ETA notifications.
- 96.9% demanded reporting tools.

### Target Users:

- Students who want reliable schedules and tracking.
- Drivers who need simplified UIs and route intelligence.
- Admins who manage assignments, analytics, and reports.

### Benefits:

- Improved academic punctuality.
- Safer, more efficient rides.
- Stronger trust between students and administration.
